# Foreword 

 I ([me](https://github.com/Jean-Baptiste-Lasselle)) created this repo on top of my fork of https://github.com/unpkg/unpkg.com, so I can store in here my resources on this tech discovery workshop.
 
 In the [./reverse-devopsing/docuementations/images/](/reverse-devopsing/docuementations/images/)  will be nested images referenced everywhere in me markdown files.
