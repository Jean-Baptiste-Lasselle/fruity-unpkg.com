# Foreword 

I ([me](https://github.com/Jean-Baptiste-Lasselle)) created this repo on top of my fork of https://github.com/unpkg/unpkg.com, so I can lead a case study on [unpkg.com](#) as a potential product I will use in my pieplines, and maybe in a strange app. I'll turn n monetize that back for my own company, out of turning it into a this tech discovery workshop

You will find everything about my tech discovery workshop in the [./reverse-devopsing/documentations/images/](/reverse-devopsing/docuementations/images/)  folder.
 
In the [./reverse-devopsing/documentations/images/](/reverse-devopsing/docuementations/images/)  will be nested images referenced everywhere in me markdown files.
